            <p class="Iam">I am Mark Zucker Burg</p>
            <p>I've spent my life immersed in the world of technology and innovation. From an early age, I was captivated by the potential of the digital landscape. This fascination led me to embark on a journey that ultimately culminated in the creation of Facebook.

                My passion for connecting people and fostering communities has been the driving force behind this endeavor. I believe that in an increasingly interconnected world, meaningful connections are at the core of progress and understanding. Facebook emerged as a platform to facilitate these connections on an unprecedented scale.
                
                Throughout this journey, I've been dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve, while also being acutely aware of the responsibilities that come with it. The mission has always been to make the world more open and connected, allowing individuals to share their stories, ideas, and experiences with a global audience.
                
                But the story is far from over. I remain committed to innovation and to finding new ways to leverage technology for the betterment of society. It's a privilege to be part of this ongoing revolution, and I'm grateful for the opportunities it continues to present. Together, we're shaping the digital landscape in ways that hold the potential to impact lives across the globe.</p>

                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p>Although I studied engineering, I eventually realized that a degree was not worth anything. That is when I recognized that other students were struggling with the same issue. They were earning degrees, but those degrees were not helping them get jobs. Having been an engineer all my life, I wanted to engineer a solution.</p>

                    <h4>Business</h4>
                    <p>When I was in college, I had no one to guide me on what to do. I did not have any mentorship myself. Soon, I released that there is no direction and guidance that helps students choose the right career path. There is no one to help the students tap into the knowledge of those with more experience than themselves.</p>

                    <p>In 2013, I began my writing career on Quora by answering and resolving questions based on my coding expertise. From there, I rose to the position of top writer. At the same time, I launched a newsletter in which I documented the lessons I had learned in both my personal and professional lives. This newsletter assisted thousands of students and developers in developing both personally and professionally.</p>
